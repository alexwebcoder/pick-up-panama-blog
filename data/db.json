      "intro": "Panama is regarded as one of the safest countries in Central America. You will find that most Panamanians are friendly and welcoming people. ",
      "moderateCrime": "There is a moderate crime rate in Panama. The crime rate in Panama City is much lower than in some major US cities such as St. Louis, Missouri, and Chicago, Illinois. The past three years have seen a slight increase in Panama's crime rate.",
      "despiteThis": "Despite this, the likelihood of you being mugged is slim. Most establishments are patrolled by police and armed security. While this can give you a sense of safety, there are other precautionary measures you can take to maintain safety in Panama.",
      "thisArticle": "This article will cover preventing muggings, recognizing scams, health and safety and areas to avoid.",
      "h2targets": "Who are the prime targets for muggers?",
      "criteria": "Muggers have different criteria that dictate who their next victim will be. Gender, age, physical build, how you are dressed, time of day and whether or not you are alone all factor in.",
      "h3alone": "People who are alone",
      "commonTarget": "The most common target for a mugger is someone who is alone and in an isolated area. Train station platforms, alleys or parking lots are where you need to exercise extreme caution. Do your best to avoid any desolate areas. If you do take the train, stay alert and keep close to other commuters.",
      "Oftentimes": "Oftentimes, a mugger will approach under the pretense of asking you for directions or making small talk.  If this happens, you can go ahead and give them directions but keep your distance, glance at their hands and confidently look them straight in the eyes. If you are walking and they come up and start walking alongside you, don't break stride and head to the nearest crowded area if they continue to follow you.",
      "unsurePeople": "People who look unsure of themselves",
      "bodyLanguage": "Muggers will size up a person's body language before making their move. They target people who look inattentive, lost or distracted. They are looking for a person who has a lazy slouching posture or looks at the ground when they walk. Plan your routes ahead of time so that you know where you are going before you even leave your hotel. If you have to ask for directions on the way, a mugger may think that you are lost and target you. The best case scenario is to plan your route so that you will be walking down main streets with lots of people on them.",
      "ifAble": "If you are able, walk tall with your shoulders back and your eyes level. This will help you become more aware of your surroundings. Maintain situational awareness by leaving your headphones off and don't text or look at your phone while you walk.",
      "goingAroundCorners": "When you are going around corners, take wide turns so that you can see what is around the corner. Muggers like to ambush people as they come around corners.",
      "muggersMoveIn": "Muggers will go after somebody who is walking while texting because it is clear that they are not paying attention. Watch and listen to your surroundings. If you do so, you will be able to spot potential threats. If you do see a potential threat, move to a safer area.",
      "takeNote": "Take note of people sitting in parked cars and people who appear to just be standing around. Glance side to side from time to time as you walk and quickly make eye contact when you walk past people. Walking with purpose and showing that you are not afraid of a little eye contact will show that you are a confident and on the ball person. You will not be the first choice for a mugger.",
      "whenYouEnter": "When you enter the location that you are going to, do a quick scan of the people around you and assess the mood/atmosphere of the place. Sit with a vantage point that allows you to see the entrance and check to see where the emergency exits are ahead of time.",
      "h3wealth": "People who project wealth",
      "cuffLinks": "Muggers target people who appear to have money. Tourists with expensive clothes, jewelry, or designer sunglasses and cufflinks are prime targets.",
      "makeEffort": "Make an effort to avoid dressing or acting like a tourist. Upscale apparel and high end items will inform muggers that you are not from the area and that you have money. Dress modestly, don't overdo it with selfies and don't flash wads of money. Leave expensive jewelry at home. Just carry enough money for whatever you need for that outing and leave the rest hidden in your hotel room.",
      "ensureThat": "Make sure to look around carefully and trust your intuition before accessing your cash to pay for something, use an ATM machine, or take a selfie. If something just seems suspicious or out of place, hold off on that until you find a safer location.",
      "h2whatToDo": "What to do if you are getting mugged",
      "ifMugged": "If you are mugged, simply comply with the mugger and give them what they want so that you don't risk injury. Don't argue with them or try to talk to them. All of the prevention measures mentioned earlier and confidence may still not be enough to deter a mugger.",
      "manyMuggers": "Many muggers are looking to commit their crime quickly, quietly and without assaulting the victim. However, muggers are desperate people who will resort to physical or armed violence to get what they want.",
      "dummyWallet": "You may want to consider keeping a dummy wallet on you. This is a wallet that would contain small bills, old receipts, coupons, business cards and an expired credit card. The idea is that in case of a mugging you can throw this toward the mugger so that you are not out a lot of cash and your real credit cards.",
      "h2HighCrime": "High crime areas in Panama",

It is usually pretty crowded so watch out for pickpockets. Whenever I walk through there and to the Fish Market, I always feel safe. The Presidential Palace is nearby, so you will see lots of police and group tours.",

      "colonIsOn": "Colon is on the Atlantic side and is known as a high crime area. If you want to visit, I would say to go with an established company that gives tours of Colon.
